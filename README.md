Project COMADY: COmputational Modeling of Aging Dynamics

## Overview

COMADY is a project that aims to develop a computational model of aging dynamics. Instead of focusing too much on the biological details of aging, we ask whether it is possible to write a complex system simulation that captures the essence of aging dynamics. The model is based on the idea that aging is a stochastic process that is driven by stochastic events as well as deterministic processes that govern our development and growth. The current model is overly simple but we hope that by successive refinement and validation, we can develop a computational model that can be used to build a better theoretical understanding of aging dynamics.

### The Why

Most people in the community believe that we can have a mathematical model of aging that uses a few variables to model the whole thing. However, this project is motivated by the fact that complex adaptive systems can not be reduced to a few variables. Stephen Wolfram calls this idea the Principle of Computational Irreducibility. This broadly means that we can not predict the behavior of a complex system without actually running the simulation. This is the reason why we need to build a computational model of aging dynamics.
